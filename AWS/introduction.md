# AWS

## Introduction

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources through a cloud services platform via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

### Types of Cloud Computing

- **Intrastructure as a Service (IaaS):** We have maximum control. We run virtual servers in the cloud  with fully access to them, but requires high maintenance.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):** This is a service that is configured for us where we will deploy our customizations onto it. Similar to WP Engines in a way. It's also worth noting, that the AWS solution for this is _Elastic Beanstalk_.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS):** These require minimum maintenance.

## Cloud Deployment Modules

- **Public Cloud:** Deploy a solution into a public cloud provider, like AWS or Azure.
- **On-Premises (Private Cloud):** Cloud-like platform in a private data center.
- **Hybrid:** Cloud apps connected to a private data center.
